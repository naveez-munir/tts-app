Total Travel Solution Booking Platform Workflow & Operating Process

Total Travel Solution is a software-based booking and marketplace platform designed to connect customers with independent, locally licensed taxi offices. The company does not provide transport services directly. Instead, its primary functions include receiving booking requests, facilitating a structured bidding process, confirming bookings between customers and licensed operators, and charging a commission for each completed booking. All transport services are carried out by fully licensed third-party taxi offices and drivers.
1. Customer Booking Creation
Customers can submit booking requests using various channels, including the website, mobile platform, email, or by telephone (with manual entry by an administrator). Each booking request is assigned a unique, system-generated reference number, which is essential for internal tracking, partner bidding, customer communication, invoicing, and dispute resolution. No booking will proceed without a valid reference number.
2. Job Distribution to Local Taxi Offices
After receiving a booking request, the system identifies suitable taxi offices based on factors such as the pickup postcode, service area, and vehicle capacity requirements. The job is then released into the bidding marketplace, with the reference number clearly displayed. Taxi offices may view the job details but must quote the reference number when submitting a bid.
3. Bidding Window
Taxi offices are given a one-hour window from the moment the job is released to accept the job, submit a fare offer, or reject it. Every bid must include the booking reference number. Any bid without a valid reference number may be automatically rejected by the system.
4. Bid Selection Process
When the bidding window closes, the three lowest valid bids are shortlisted. The lowest compliant bid is provisionally selected, provided that the taxi office holds active partner status, has valid licensing, vehicle suitability, and confirms the reference number. If the selected bidder fails to respond or comply, the job may be offered to the next lowest bidder.



5. Job Acceptance and Reference Confirmation
A taxi office accepting a job must confirm acceptance formally by quoting the reference number. Acceptance without reference confirmation is considered invalid. Once acceptance is confirmed, the booking status updates to “Accepted – Pending Driver Details”.
6. Driver Assignment and Information Submission
The winning taxi office must assign a driver and submit driver details using the Driver Assignment Form, referencing the booking number. The required information includes the driver’s full legal name, contact number, vehicle make and model, vehicle registration number, taxi licence number, and issuing local council. Driver details not linked to the correct reference number will not be processed.
7. Customer and Driver Confirmation
Upon verification of driver details, both the booking reference number and driver details are shared with the customer. The assigned driver is responsible for contacting the customer and quoting the reference number to confirm pickup details, introduce themselves, and prevent confusion or fraud. All communication regarding the journey must reference the booking number.
8. Journey Fulfilment
The journey is conducted by the licensed driver under the responsibility of the taxi office. The reference number must be used for addressing any issues during the journey, delays or amendments, and post-journey queries.
9. Completion, Invoicing, and Commission
Once the journey is complete, taxi offices are required to report completion using the reference number. Any invoices or completion confirmations must quote the reference number, which is also used to calculate and deduct the agreed commission.
10. Roles and Responsibilities

11. Platform Control and Compliance
All accepted jobs must have a valid reference number. Jobs without reference numbers are not recognised by Total Travel Solution. This strict process is designed to protect customers, drivers, taxi offices, and the platform itself.
