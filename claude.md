# AIRPORT TRANSFER BOOKING PLATFORM - PROJECT GUIDELINES

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** December 2025
**Architecture:** Separate Backend (NestJS) + Frontend (Next.js)

---

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Description
Marketplace platform connecting customers seeking airport transfers with registered transport operators across the UK.

### Business Model
- **Asset-light aggregator**: No vehicle ownership
- **Bidding system**: Jobs broadcast to all operators, lowest bid wins
- **Revenue model**: Commission (Customer Price - Winning Bid)
- **Primary service**: Airport transfers with point-to-point support

### Core Differentiator
Automated bidding system where all registered operators in the service area receive job notifications and compete by submitting bids. The lowest bid automatically wins, maximizing platform margin while ensuring competitive pricing.

### Target Timeline
**10-12 weeks for MVP** (Minimum Viable Product)

## 3. STRICT SCOPE CONTROL RULES FOR AI DEVELOPMENT

When working on this project, the AI assistant MUST adhere to these rules:

### Prohibited Actions:
- ✋ **NO feature suggestions** beyond the defined scope during development
- ✋ **NO "nice to have" additions** or enhancements unless explicitly requested
- ✋ **NO future-proofing** beyond current requirements (don't add fields "for future use")
- ✋ **NO over-engineering** - implement the simplest solution that meets requirements
- ✋ **NO copying** ots-uk.co.uk design, layout, colors, or content (copyright risk)

### Required Actions:
- ✅ **Flight number field** should be collected and stored as plain text only (VARCHAR/TEXT) - no API integration, no validation beyond basic format
- ✅ **Focus exclusively** on delivering the defined MVP features
- ✅ **Any scope changes** must be explicitly approved by the user and documented in this file
- ✅ **When in doubt**, ask the user rather than making assumptions or adding features
- ✅ **Prioritize completion** over perfection - working MVP is better than incomplete feature-rich application
- ✅ **Use ots-uk.co.uk ONLY as functional reference** (what features they have, how flows work)
- ✅ **Create 100% original design** and copywriting

### Shared Types Package

**Purpose**: Ensure type consistency between frontend and backend

**Structure:**
```
packages/shared-types/
├── index.ts              # Main export file
├── user.types.ts         # User, OperatorProfile types
├── booking.types.ts      # Booking, Job, Bid types
├── payment.types.ts      # Transaction, Payment types
├── enums.ts              # All enums (UserRole, BookingStatus, etc.)
└── schemas/              # Zod schemas
    ├── booking.schema.ts
    ├── user.schema.ts
    └── bid.schema.ts
```

**Usage:**
- Backend imports for validation and type safety
- Frontend imports for form validation and API types
- Single source of truth for data structures

**Example:**
```typescript
// packages/shared-types/enums.ts
export enum UserRole {
  CUSTOMER = 'CUSTOMER',
  OPERATOR = 'OPERATOR',
  ADMIN = 'ADMIN'
}

export enum BookingStatus {
  PENDING_PAYMENT = 'PENDING_PAYMENT',
  PAID = 'PAID',
  ASSIGNED = 'ASSIGNED',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'IN_PROGRESS',
  COMPLETED = 'COMPLETED',
  CANCELLED = 'CANCELLED',
  REFUNDED = 'REFUNDED'
}

// packages/shared-types/schemas/booking.schema.ts
import { z } from 'zod';

export const CreateBookingSchema = z.object({
  pickupLocation: z.object({
    address: z.string().min(1),
    postcode: z.string().min(1),
    lat: z.number(),
    lng: z.number()
  }),
  dropoffLocation: z.object({
    address: z.string().min(1),
    postcode: z.string().min(1),
    lat: z.number(),
    lng: z.number()
  }),
  pickupDatetime: z.string().datetime(),
  passengerCount: z.number().min(1).max(16),
  luggageCount: z.number().min(0),
  vehicleType: z.enum(['SALOON', 'ESTATE', 'MPV', 'EXECUTIVE', 'MINIBUS']),
  flightNumber: z.string().optional(),
  specialRequirements: z.object({
    childSeats: z.number().optional(),
    wheelchairAccess: z.boolean().optional(),
    pets: z.boolean().optional()
  }).optional()
});

export type CreateBookingDto = z.infer<typeof CreateBookingSchema>;
```

---

## 5. CODE CONSISTENCY STANDARDS

### TypeScript Standards

**Shared Types Location:**
- Create `packages/shared-types` directory in monorepo
- Export all shared types, interfaces, enums, and Zod schemas
- Both frontend and backend import from this shared location
- Keep frontend-specific and backend-specific types in their respective projects

**Type Definitions:**
- Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json for both projects
- Use `interface` for object shapes that may be extended, `type` for unions/intersections
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` and type guards if type is truly unknown
- Use `enum` for fixed sets of values (e.g., UserRole, BookingStatus, VehicleType)
- Define Zod schemas alongside TypeScript types for runtime validation
- Use `z.infer<typeof schema>` to derive TypeScript types from Zod schemas

**Naming Conventions:**
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`, `BookingRequest`)
- Enums: PascalCase for enum name, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for values (e.g., `enum UserRole { CUSTOMER = 'CUSTOMER' }`)
- Variables/Functions: camelCase (e.g., `calculateQuote`, `bookingData`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PASSENGERS`, `DEFAULT_BIDDING_WINDOW`)
- React Components: PascalCase (e.g., `BookingForm`, `VehicleCard`)
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `booking-form.tsx`, `calculate-quote.ts`)

### Database Field Naming

- Use snake_case for all PostgreSQL column names (e.g., `first_name`, `created_at`, `booking_reference`)
- Prisma will auto-map to camelCase in generated client (e.g., `firstName`, `createdAt`, `bookingReference`)
- Boolean fields: prefix with `is_` or `has_` (e.g., `is_active`, `has_wheelchair_access`)
- Timestamp fields: suffix with `_at` (e.g., `created_at`, `updated_at`, `completed_at`)
- Foreign keys: suffix with `_id` (e.g., `user_id`, `operator_id`, `booking_id`)

### API Naming Conventions

**Endpoint Structure (RESTful):**
- Use kebab-case for multi-word resources: `/api/transport-companies`, `/api/pricing-rules`
- Resource-based URLs: `/api/bookings`, `/api/jobs`, `/api/bids`
- Use HTTP methods correctly: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (delete)
- Nested resources: `/api/jobs/:jobId/bids`, `/api/bookings/:bookingId/transactions`
- Actions that don't fit REST: POST `/api/jobs/:jobId/assign`, POST `/api/bookings/:bookingId/refund`

**Examples:**
- `GET /api/bookings` - List all bookings (with pagination, filters)
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking
- `GET /api/bookings/:id` - Get booking details
- `PATCH /api/bookings/:id` - Update booking
- `POST /api/jobs/:jobId/bids` - Submit bid on job
- `GET /api/operators/dashboard` - Get operator dashboard data

### API Response Format

**Success Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: { /* response payload */ },
  meta: { /* pagination, timestamps, etc. */ }
}
```

**Error Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: false,
  error: {
    code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', // machine-readable error code
    message: 'Invalid booking details', // human-readable message
    details: [ /* array of specific validation errors */ ]
  }
}
```

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- 200: Success (GET, PATCH, PUT)
- 201: Created (POST)
- 204: No Content (DELETE)
- 400: Bad Request (validation errors)
- 401: Unauthorized (not authenticated)
- 403: Forbidden (authenticated but not authorized)
- 404: Not Found
- 409: Conflict (e.g., duplicate booking reference)
- 500: Internal Server Error

```

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Use ESLint with TypeScript rules for both projects
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Write JSDoc comments for complex functions and public APIs
- Separate business logic from presentation (services pattern in backend, custom hooks in frontend)
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic in React components
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Prefer composition over prop drilling (use Context API for deeply nested state)

## 6. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW & BEST PRACTICES

### Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feature/booking-flow`, `fix/payment-validation`, `refactor/api-responses`
- Commit message format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(booking): add quote calculation`, `fix(auth): resolve token expiration`)
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write descriptive commit messages explaining "why" not just "what"

### Testing Requirements

**Backend Testing:**
- Unit tests for services and utility functions (Jest)
- Integration tests for API endpoints (Supertest)
- Test database operations with test database or mocks
- Test coverage target: 70%+ for critical paths (booking flow, bidding system, payment processing)

**Frontend Testing:**
- Component tests for UI components (React Testing Library)
- Integration tests for forms and user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths (Playwright or Cypress) - optional for MVP
- Test coverage target: 60%+ for critical components

### Deployment Process

**Frontend (Vercel):**
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Automatic deployments on push to main branch
4. Preview deployments for pull requests

**Backend (Railway/Render):**
1. Connect GitHub repository to Railway/Render
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up PostgreSQL and Redis add-ons
4. Configure build command: `npm run build`
5. Configure start command: `npm run start:prod`
6. Set up health check endpoint: `GET /health`

**Database Migrations:**
- Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` in production
- Never run `prisma migrate dev` in production
- Always test migrations in staging environment first


### Monitoring & Logging

- Use structured logging (Winston or Pino in NestJS)
- Log levels: error, warn, info, debug
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, credit card numbers)
- Set up error tracking (Sentry or similar) - optional for MVP
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Set up database query monitoring

## 7. DESIGN & RESPONSIVENESS STANDARDS

### Design Principles

- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Create 100% original design and copywriting
- ⚠️ **DO NOT copy** ots-uk.co.uk design, layout, color scheme, or content (copyright infringement risk)
- ✅ **Use ots-uk.co.uk ONLY as functional reference** (what features they have, how booking flow works)
- ✅ **Create unique branding**: original color palette, typography, logo concept, UI patterns
- ✅ **Professional aesthetic**: trustworthy, modern, clean design appropriate for transport booking
- ✅ **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

### Tailwind CSS Configuration Requirements

**Centralized Theme in `tailwind.config.ts`:**
- All colors defined in `theme.extend.colors` - NO hardcoded hex values in components
- Define color palette with semantic names: primary, secondary, accent, neutral, success, warning, error
- Each color should have shades: 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900
- All spacing values in `theme.extend.spacing` if custom values needed
- Typography scale in `theme.extend.fontSize` with line heights
- Border radius values in `theme.extend.borderRadius`
- Box shadows in `theme.extend.boxShadow`
- Breakpoints in `theme.extend.screens` if custom breakpoints needed
- Easy theme switching: changing colors in config should update entire app

### Responsive Design Requirements

**Mobile-First Approach:**
- Design for mobile first (320px minimum width), then scale up
- All layouts must work on: iPhone SE (375px), standard mobile (390px-428px), tablets (768px-1024px), desktop (1280px+)
- Test at various viewport heights: 600px, 800px, 1080px, 1440px

**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- sm: 640px (large phones, small tablets)
- md: 768px (tablets)
- lg: 1024px (small laptops)
- xl: 1280px (desktops)
- 2xl: 1536px (large desktops)

**Responsive Rules:**
- ❌ **NEVER use hardcoded pixel values** like `w-[900px]`, `h-[450px]`, `text-[18px]`
- ✅ **ALWAYS use Tailwind utility classes** with theme values: `w-full`, `max-w-4xl`, `h-screen`, `text-lg`
- ✅ **Use responsive variants**: `w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3`
- ✅ **Flexible layouts**: Use flexbox and grid with responsive classes
- ✅ **Touch-friendly**: Minimum 44px × 44px tap targets on mobile (buttons, links, form inputs)
- ✅ **Readable text**: Minimum 16px base font size on mobile, proper line height (1.5-1.75)
- ✅ **Proper spacing**: Adequate padding and margins that scale with breakpoints

## 8. SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for the Airport Transfer Booking Platform project. All development decisions, architecture choices, and feature implementations must align with the guidelines defined here.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Scope Discipline**: Only implement features listed in Section 2.1-2.10. No additions without explicit approval.
2. **Architecture**: Separate NestJS backend + Next.js frontend with shared types package.
3. **Core Feature**: Bidding system where operators compete for jobs - this is the differentiator.
4. **Timeline**: 10-12 weeks for MVP with focused scope.
5. **Quality**: Type-safe, tested, accessible, responsive, and secure.

### Before Starting Development

- [ ] Review and approve this CLAUDE.md document
- [ ] Review DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (to be created)
- [ ] Review API_SPECIFICATION.md (to be created)
- [ ] Review FRONTEND_STRUCTURE.md (to be created)
- [ ] Review TAILWIND_THEME.md (to be created)
- [ ] Set up development environment (Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- [ ] Register for API accounts (Stripe, Google Maps, SendGrid, Twilio)
- [ ] Create project repositories (monorepo or separate repos)

### Development Order (Recommended)

1. **Phase 1**: Project setup, database schema, authentication
2. **Phase 2**: Customer booking flow, quote engine, Google Maps integration
3. **Phase 3**: Stripe payment integration, booking confirmation
4. **Phase 4**: Operator portal, registration, job viewing
5. **Phase 5**: Bidding system, job assignment, notifications
6. **Phase 6**: Admin panel, operator management, reports
7. **Phase 7**: Testing, bug fixes, security audit
8. **Phase 8**: Deployment, monitoring setup
